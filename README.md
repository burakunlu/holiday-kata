# Holiday Service

For cost and price calculation we need to know if an order is processed on a public holiday. Until now this was handled in every project and implemented in a different way. To make it easier to administrate and use the data in future projects we decided to implement this in a single holiday service.


Our IT Solution Engineers created an API Definition which should be used as a reference. You can also find the OpenApi Spec as json or as yaml in `./api-contract/`

Please implement a working prototype (We prefer spring and gradle, but if you feel more comfortable using other java-frameworks go for it!). We don't care if the dates are real holidays, any example data will do. You do not need to conern yourself with data adminstration.

If you have any question feel free to contact us via robert.hibbeler@time-matters.com or benedikt.koch@time-matters.com. And please don't spend more than 4 hours on this project.
